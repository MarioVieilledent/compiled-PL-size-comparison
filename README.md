# Compiled programming language size comparison

> Zig is the best!

> Go is the worse :c

I coded a simple calc program that parse integers, parse a char, and print the result of operation.

I compare here the size of the exe file compiled on Win64.

| Language | Size in kb |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Zig      | 8.5        |
| C        | 11.5       |
| C++      | 20.0       |
| Rust     | 216.6      |
| Go       | 1380.4     |
